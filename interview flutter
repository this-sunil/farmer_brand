🚀 Flutter Interview Series — Day 1

📌 Q1: What is Flutter?
Flutter is Google’s open-source UI toolkit for building cross-platform apps (Android, iOS, Web, Desktop) from a single codebase using Dart. It provides its own rendering engine for consistent UI across platforms.

📌 Q2: What is Dart and why Flutter uses it?
Dart is a client-optimized language. Flutter uses it for Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation (fast production apps) and Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation (fast development with Hot Reload).

📌 Q3: What are Widgets in Flutter?
Widgets are the basic building blocks of UI. Everything in Flutter is a widget — text, buttons, layout containers, etc.

📌 Q4: Difference between StatelessWidget and StatefulWidget

StatelessWidget → UI is immutable
StatefulWidget → UI changes dynamically with setState() or state management.

📌 Q5: What is Hot Reload?
Updates the running app instantly without losing the current state, speeding up UI development.
